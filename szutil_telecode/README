This mod adds the "/tc" command, which allows teleportation by code.

- "/tc" gets the telecode for the current location.
- "/tc <code>" teleports to the specified location.

Teleportation codes, i.e. "telecodes", are 16-digit hex numbers which
contain an encrypted position (rounded to center of node) and an
authentication checksum.  They are effectively opaque to players, and
cannot be guessed, decoded, modified, or compared (other than exact
equality) without knowing the server's private encryption key.  Keys
are per-server/per-world, so telecodes from one world, or from single
player, cannot be used on a different server.

The mod also provides some bookmarking capabilities so players only
need to deal with the codes when they want to share/publish them.
- /tcsave <name> - save current location to a bookmark.
- /tcsave <name> [code] - save location from telecode as bookmark.
- /tcls - list all bookmarks
- /tcls <search> - list all bookmarks matching search
- /trcm <name> - remove a bookmark
- /tcsend * <name> - share a bookmark with everyone via chat
- /tcsend <player> <name> - share a bookmark with player via DM
- /tcsend * - share current location telecode with everyone
- /tcsend <player> - send current location to player via DM

Players must be able to physically travel to a location to find the
telecode for it, but may then later freely travel to that location at
any time, and/or share the code with anyone they want via any means
at their disposal, such as in-game chat, posting on wikis/forums, etc.

Valid new telecodes that are received via chat or DM are automatically
saved in bookmarks, named ^, ^2, ^3, ^4, and ^5, in order of most
recently received, except for any telecodes already bookmarked.
These special bookmarks can also be used in the place of an explicit
code for /tcsave.

This mod is compatible with NodeCore, and follows NodeCore's item
transport restrictions.  When the game is NodeCore, players can move
about freely, but items must be left behind when using a
non-gameplay-integrated teleportation system like this.
