This mod exposes a UNIX-domain socket for integrating arbitrary external
chat relay systems.  You can use OpenBSD's netcat (nc -U) to connect to
the console from a regular command line, though the preferred way is to
connect a bridge program to act as a client for both this socket and the
external chat system.

The communication protocol is simple: all in-game chat (including emote,
player join/leave, etc) messages will be broadcast to all connected
socket clients.  Each line of input text received (newline-terminated)
from any socket client will be displayed in-game and broadcast to all
other connected socket clients.

mod must be listed in the "secure.trusted_mods" setting.
