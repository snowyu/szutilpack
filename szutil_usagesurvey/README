This mod maintains a summary of player interactions with the map on a
per-mapblock, per-player basis, and records totals to a file-based
database in a subdir of the world.

Interactions include time spent standing/moving, and counts of actions
such as nodes dug/placed, deaths/respawns, joins/leaves, hp hurt/healed,
etc.

The purpose of this data collection is to allow a server admin to
identify valuable areas of a world map, i.e. areas that players have the
most effort invested in, e.g. for pruning databases, prioritizing
backups, showcasing builds, etc.
