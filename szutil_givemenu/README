This mod adds a /givemenu command that provides menu-driven access to
the /give[me] commands.

Use the command:
	/givemenu [optional search]
to bring up the menu.

In the search box, you can type in keywords.  The entire description
AND technical name is searched (case-insensitive) for each keyword you
enter and all must match.

At the bottom, you can choose to whom to give the item (default is
yourself).

Double-click an item to give it.  Use Esc or your "inventory" keybind
to close the menu.

The /gm command is a shortcut to /givemenu, as long as no other mod
registers a /gm command at load-time.
