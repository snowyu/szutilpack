Adds a /nuke_player command, which removes a player COMPLETELY,
including all player data (as per /remove_player), privileges,
password, and other account info.

This level of destruction is necessary for minetest.player_exists to
return false and allow mods to detect the destruction of the player
account for automatic cleanup purposes.

Because it affects account privileges and can be used to destroy
admin accounts, the superuser "privs" priv is required to use it.
