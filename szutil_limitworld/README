Limit the size of the generated world (i.e. to limit its HDD space
usage).  Terrain outside the generated bounds will be filled with air
(leaving the allowed continent as a floating island), discouraging
players from travelling much farther beyond.

Players that fall outside of the world will be damaged based on
their falling speed, to prevent them from being stuck in limbo,
falling forever.  Travel outside the world IS allowed, if players
do not free-fall.

See init.lua for configuration details.  The only required setting
is szutil_limitworld_scale; if this is not set, the mod is effectively
disabled.
