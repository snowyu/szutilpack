This mod provides:

	- A framework for dealing with some of the most frequently-used
	  types and operations (e.g. 3d position vectors) in an object-
	  oriented manner (e.g. a:add(b) instead of helper.add(a, b))

	- Convenience wrappers for more complex operations, many with
	  optional parameters with sane defaults (e.g. pos:smoke())

	- A few language extensions (e.g. string:startswith(prefix))

	- A couple of new chat commands for debugging by mod authors
	  (server privileges required).

This mod is meant to be used as a dependency by other mods, and should
have no direct impact on gameplay by itself.
