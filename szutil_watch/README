This mod adds a "spectator mode."

- the "/watch <player>" command, to watch another player.
- the "/unwatch" command to return to normal play.
- the "/watchshare <list>" command sets a list of players allowed to
  watch a player without the "watch" privilege.

Players who have the "watch" privilege can always watch any other player
who isn't already watching another player or otherwise invisible.

Using the watchshare command allows a player to share their play
experience with other players (effectively in-game "streaming").  The
parameter is a whitelist of exact player names, or "*" to allow any
player.  The list is cleared automatically when the player logs out;
to reshare after rejoining, the command needs to be used again (this
is a safeguard against accidentally leaving it open).
