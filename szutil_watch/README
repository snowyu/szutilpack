This mod adds a "spectator mode."  Players with the "watch" privilege
can use:

- the "/watch <player>" command, to watch another player.
- the "/watchall" command, to watch an arbitrarily selected set of
  players (up to the number of hotbar slots) by using hotbar switching.
- the "/unwatch" command to return to normal play.
