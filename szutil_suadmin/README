This mod allows administering a server using a single, shared password.
Any user who knows the password can authenticate with it and gain the
"privs" privilege, which allows them to gain any other privilege.  This
may be a useful alternative to using the "name" setting, which forces
one specific account always to have all permissions.

Set the sz_suadmin_password setting to the desired shared password.
Plain-text passwords are automatically upgraded to salted hashes as
appropriate; this may rewrite the config file at startup time.  Enable
the sz_suadmin_strict setting to require a /su password to access
the "privs" privilege; users are strippd of it on login/logout
automatically.

See the "/su" and "/unsu" commands for in-game admin access.
