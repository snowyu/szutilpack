This mod requires new players to accept terms of use in the MOTD via a
chat command before they can play.

- Remove interact (and possibly other privs) from default_privs.
- Add any additional privs to szutil_motdagree_grant.

Players will be required to enter the specified chat comamnd (default
is "/agree to terms") to gain the sequestered privileges and start
actual play.  This self-grant via agreeing to the terms only works once,
so admins can still revoke these privs manually later.

Customizing the chat command and required parameters allows this mod
to test for reading comprehension (by burying the chat command
instructions inside the MOTD), and ensure that players are not just
ignoring the rules and agreeing just to dismiss the message, and thus
players have no excuse for ignoring warnings.

Optionally, by setting szutil_motdagree_purge to true, users who log off
without agreeing to the terms will be purged from the system and need
to re-register each time until they agree to the terms.

Moderators (who have the ban priv) can enable/disable new registrations
using the /szutil_motdagree command.  When registration is closed,
players can enter the "lobby" but cannot agree to the terms until
registration is opened again.
