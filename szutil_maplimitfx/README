This mod displays a particle effect at the hard map boundary, allowing
players to visualize the difference between areas not yet loaded and
a tangible boundary.

It automatically uses the built-in mapgen_limit map setting.

No nodes are altered in this process, so the limit can be raised later
by simply modifying the map_meta.txt of the world.  When the world is
reloaded, the new limit will be honored by this mod.
