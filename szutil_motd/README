This mod displays a pop-up message to players automatically upon login
using a nice formspec interface.  Messages are only displayed
automatically if changed since the last viewing, or if the player has
never seen the message before.  Players can summon the message manually
with a chat command.

This can be used to display server rules, hints, and/or news on player
login.  The form is designed for 72-column hand-wrapped text, and
displays using minetest's proportional font (indentations do not
necessarily line up).
