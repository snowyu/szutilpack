This mod smoothly syncs the in-world clock with the real-world clock,
such that sunrise happens at :00, :20, and :40 minutes past the hour,
so players can plan their login times onto an MP server to happen at a
time of day conducive to starting out gameplay.

The adjustments are made gradually, i.e. by speeding up or slowing down
in-game time flow until it syncs up, and then making fine adjustments
to keep it very close to precisely synced.  This avoids any kind of
large distracting jumps from setting the clock, so the time of day
advances continuously.
