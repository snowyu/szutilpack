Set up each new player with a distinct home area, starting at (0, 0)
and spiraling outward.  This placement should provide the maximum space
between players to allow room for builds, but use map space efficiently.

The actual spiral is an Archemedian spiral, and players are placed at
Golden Angle rotations along it.

If the "beds" mod (from MTG) is installed, then the player's initial
respawn point is set.  If not, then the player will be teleported
to home upon respawn.

If the "sethome" mod (from MTG) is installed, then the player's
initial home position is set.

If the "areas" mod is installed, then the player will start out
with a configurable area around the new home protected.
