When players log in or log out, reannounce the cumulative list of online
players.  This is particularly useful for szutil_chatsocket connections
to external chat bridges, where no command is provided for getting the
list of online players.

Player lists are only sent if either a certain amount of time has
passed, or a certain number of public chat lines, since the last
announcement (configurable) to prevent a ton of noise on busy servers.

The maximum number of names listed is configurable; beyond that limit,
a random sample of players will be shown, and "(# more)" displayed at
the end of the list.
