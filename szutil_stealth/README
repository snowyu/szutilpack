------------------------------------------------------------------------

This mod tries to make a player completely invisible, including in-game
model, nametag, muting join/leave messages, and not displaying the name
in the status line.  This can be used for administering a server or
spectating the action without accidentally affecting player behavior or
disrupting the normal flow of things.

Currently the "stealth" attribute is managed by a priv.  Granting the
priv does not change the player state in realtime; a re-login may be
necessary.

Players cannot currently toggle stealth voluntarily.  Note that toggling
the priv while the affected player is logged in may cause login/logout
messages to mismatch, revealing the use of stealth.
