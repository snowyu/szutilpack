Display a full near-realtime analysis of server "lag", i.e. globalstep
dtimes.  This allows admins to monitor system performance, or mod
authors to monitor code performance impact, continuously, instead of
having to do /status over and over.

The visualization is a weighted histogram, where time is sorted into
buckets by step size, and each bucket contains the total amount of time
spent performing steps of that size.  The number on the right is the
step size (max) for that bucket, the number on the left is the total
time in that bucket, and the bar graph visually approximates (up to a
limit) the time value.  Instead of just an average, this visualization
shows distribution of step sizes, making it possible to identify
specific types of spikes.

Players will see the lagometer if they have the "lagometer" priv, and
enable the lagometer toggle via the /lagometer command.  The meter
displays on the bottom right of the screen.
