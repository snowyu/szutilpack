Display a full near-realtime analysis of server "lag", i.e. globalstep
dtimes.  This allows admins to monitor system performance, or mod
authors to monitor code performance impact, continuously, instead of
having to do /status over and over.

The visualization is a weighted histogram.  See the description of the
lagometer command (i.e. /help lagometer) for more detail.

Players will see the lagometer if they have the "lagometer" priv, and
enable the lagometer toggle via the /lagometer command.  The meter
displays on the bottom right of the screen.
