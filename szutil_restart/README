This mod provides a way to gracefully shut down a server from external
triggers (i.e. scripts) with a graceful countdown to warn players.
A server restart is triggered by creating a file named "restart" inside
the world dir.

Note that this only manages shutting down the server from inside; your
script MUST provide the server restarting, and MUST provide the actual
restarting capability, and MUST remove the "restart" file before
starting the server to prevent triggering a restart loop.
