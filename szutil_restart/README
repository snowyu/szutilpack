This mod provides a way to gracefully shut down a server from external
triggers (i.e. scripts) with a graceful countdown to warn players.
A server restart is triggered by creating a file named "restart" inside
the world dir, or use of a chatcommand.

Note that this only manages shutting down the server from inside; your
script MUST provide the actual restarting capability after the server
exits, and MUST remove the "restart" file before starting the server to
prevent triggering a restart loop.

If no players are present, then the server will shut down immediately;
players can all leave the server to skip the countdown.  Silent restarts
are done quietly if no announcement was originally made, to avoid
creating noise in chat bridges.
