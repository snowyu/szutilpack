This mod adds a per-player-configurable beep sound for incoming messages
in the in-game chat stream, to allow players on low-traffic servers not
to miss interesting goings-on in chat.

Players can use the /szutil_chatsounds command to rewrite their own
chat configuration.  Sound configuration is in the form of "gain" or
"gain:pitch" (where pitch is a multiplier, 1 is the default 440Hz tone)
for each of the message levels:
	- DMs
	- public chat
	- emotes
	- player join/part
	- server messages
	- other
If there is no config for a message level then the last config will be
used.  Setting the last config to 0 mutes all remaining message levels.
Setting the entire config to 0 mutes EVERYTHING.

The default sound level can be configured server-wide.  The built-in
default if not overridden at the server/player level is:
	0.5:1.2 0.25 0.25 0.25:0.8 0
