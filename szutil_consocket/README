This mod exposes a console for running administrative commands on a
UNIX-domain socket.  Multiple clients can connect and issue commands
independently.  You can use OpenBSD's netcat (nc -U) to connect to
the console from a regular command line.

Commands issued will be run as the CONSOLE "virtual player," who is
granted ALL permissions.  Ordinary clients cannot connect as the
CONSOLE player name.

Only immediate responses to command input are output to the socket.
Delayed responses, other gameplay action, and chat are not sent to
the client, and can only be seen in server logs or in-game.

mod must be listed in the "secure.trusted_mods" setting.
