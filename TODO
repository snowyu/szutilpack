- Delayed privileges mod
	- Countdown modes:
		- Always-running countdown
		- Only-while-online countdown
		- Reset-on-rejoin countdown?
	- Commands:
		- Delayed grant
		- Revoke with delayed restoration
		- Admin list/cancel/modify delays
		- Players see their own delays
	- Privilege delay HUD
		- Togglable?
		- Configurable?
	- Commands need to work with basic_privs/privs access control
	- Role-like virtual privs that convert to a delay
		- Use other mods that interact w/ privs
		- Allow creation waiting period via default_privs, motdagree

- Command alias mod
	- Allow players to register short command aliases
		- Store in player metadata per-player
	- Intercept commands ourselves to handler per-player aliases
		- register_on_chatcommand seems like it can intercept the
		  command before it's looked up in the global table and
		  prevent normal lookup.
	- Make sure we can't alias away our ability to alias/unalias
	- Inject command back into on_chat callback system
		- Make sure we can't create infinite alias loops
		- Allow meta-aliases but only up to a certain depth?

- Migrate from dockcore:
	- my_names

- Basic player stats
	- Time since join
	- Last time online
	- Total time connected
	- Total time not idle
	- Actions: chat commands, messages, digs, places, etc.
	- Could be used for:
		- Promotion decisions (mark as regular, promote to mod)
		- Account purge decisions
	- Handle "grandfathered" players (be aware if mod was not present at player creation)
		- Record time of recording start.
	- Look at usagesurvey, old nc_stats mods for ideas.

- /lua mod w/ specific priv

- Add zoom, aux control support to controlhud

- Spectator Mode mod
	- Temporarily adjust privs: lose interact, gain fly, etc.
		- noclip, teleport?
	- Change player visual?
	- Remember player position, restore upon leaving.

- Reintroduce position tracking HUDs to offlinepos?

- Need to change how con/chat socket mods access luasockets?
