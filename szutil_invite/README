Allows players to invite other players to visit their homes.  Players
CANNOT bring items with them when they teleport to visit, preventing
players from using this as a cheap item transportation exploit.

Players with the "szutil_invite" privilege can issue invitations.

Each invitation has:
- An invited player name.  Invitations are not transferrable.
- A position, set to the position of the player creating it at the time
  of creation.
- An expiration time (in game time).

Players receiving an invitation can use /visit to accept it and
teleport.  They can use /depart to return to where they were before
they accepted.  Each time they teleport this way, all inventory items
will be dumped before leaving; players are advised to stow their gear
first.

The inviting player does NOT need to be present for invited players to
visit, and invitees can visit or depart any number of times until the
invitation expires.  Players visiting at the time the invitation expires
will be sent back automatically.

The /invite command invites a player to the current location for a
specified amount of time.  Issuing another invitation to the same player
updates the existing invitation (only one can be open at a time) and
invitations can be revoked by setting the expiration time to zero.

The /visit command accepts an invitation and teleports to another player
to visit.

The /depart command ends a visitation and returns to where the player
was before accepting.
